## Intro

"Hyperion" is an engine which extracts 'Game Mechanics' from existing stories/texts.

1.  Define a structured 'Game World View' through the analysis of given stories/texts(manually or semi-automatically)
2.  Analyze the 'Game World View' and choose/detailed the 'game mechanics' automatically.
